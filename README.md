# Lookup Drive
## Overview

Hey! This is Lookup Drive, a file system project I built to explore how data structures can work together to handle files efficiently. The project is essentially a scalable file storage system that uses a custom hash map for faster file retrieval and organization. My main focus was making file lookups and filtering as smooth as possible, especially when working with larger sets of files.

## Features
* **Quick File Access**: Uses a customized hash map to speed up file searches and organization.
* **Efficient Filtering**: You can filter files by date or name, which is especially useful if you’re managing tons of files.
* **No Frills Design**: This project is all about functionality—straightforward methods and clear organization.
